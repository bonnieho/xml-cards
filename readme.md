# xml-cards

## Overview

This is an initial foray into creating a set of flash cards based on data held in an xml file then formatted in InDesign.

The plan is to start with four notecards, front and back, per sheet of letter-sized paper. The idea is to be able to store content in an xml file that can then be imported into an InDesign template so that it can be printed out onto cardstock to be cut out and used as learning flash cards. The standard US index card size is 3" x 5", but I may explore some options for smaller cards that can still be cut out of an 8.5" x 11" sheet with margins..

Another possibility is to eventually add more elements to spin off to an xml file that can store multiple choice options for quizzes.

Files:

cards-base.xml
cards-base.dtd
cards-base.css
cards.xsl

Directories:
