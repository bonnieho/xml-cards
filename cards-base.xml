======= NOTES ========

Do I want to have at least one unique identifier with each card (to avoid duplication and maybe track if randomizing as in an online quiz)?

This is simply a basic version (four notecards, front and back, per sheet of letter-sized paper?)

Eventually, adding more elements to spin off to an xml file that can store multiple choice options for quizzes.
