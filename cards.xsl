This is an initial attempt at the base xml data structure for a set of quiz-related cards.

This xml stylesheet should transform cards from xml format into PDF (or idd - InDesign) file format(s).
(or not - on second thought, maybe it's better to format the data in the clusters to import into InDesign. To do that, it might also be necessary to run a script to get the correct answer on the back of the flash card to line up correctly on the printed sheet with its corresponding question/term.)

======= NOTES ========

Standard US index card size is 3" x 5".

For data sets that contain less text, maybe explore some options for smaller cards that can still be cut out of an 8.5" x 11" sheet with margins.

Also, what about some method of identification (color stripe? certain cuts in corners?) to distinguish different sets of cards?
